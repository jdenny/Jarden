<p>Objectives of exercise:<ul>
	<li>create an Android project</li>
	<li>run app on virtual device</li>
	<li>run app on real device</li>
</ul>

<p>Create an Android project; this can be done from a command line - see
<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project.html#CommandLine">
Android Developer Guide</a> for more details; we are going to use Eclipse,
as it's easier!</p>

<ul><li>File | New | Android Application Project</li>
	<li>supply application name, package name</li>
	<li>minimum required SDK: API 8</li>
	<li>target SDK and compile with: highest available</li>
	<li>theme: one of the Holo themes</li>
	<li>accept defaults for all other options in wizard</li>
</ul>

Configure a virtual device:<ul>
	<li>Window | Android Virtual Device Manager</li>
	<li>choose one of the templates in <i>Device Definitions</i> or create one from
	 scratch using <i>Android Virtual Devices</i></li>
</ul>

Run your app on virtual device:<ul>
	<li>right-click on project name in Project Explorer, and choose
	Run As | Android application</li>
	<li>choose emulator as the target; note that the emulator is quite big,
	and may take a few minutes to start up!</li>
</ul>
Your app should say "Hello world!"

<p>Note: use the Esc key as the <i>back</i> button.</p>

<p>If you have an Android device, close down the emulator, and run your
app on your own device.</p><ul>
	<li>Plug in your device to your development machine with a USB cable.
	If you're developing on Windows, you might need to install the
	appropriate USB driver for your device.</li>
	<li>Enable USB debugging on your device.</li>
</ul>
For more information, see
<a href="http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html">
Running Your App</a> in the Android Developer Guide.

<p>If you are going to continue using the emulator, it's best to leave it running, 
as it can take some time to start up.</p>

<p>See if you can find out where the string <b><i>Hello world!</i></b>
comes from, and change it.</p>
