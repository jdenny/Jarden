<p>Add callback method <code>onBackPressed()</code> to ExplorerActivity.
Add log message to this method.</p>

<p>Run the app to confirm the log message appears.</p>

<p>Save the explorerFragment in an instance variable, e.g. in
<code>ExplorerActivity.onCreate()</code>:</p><pre>
this.explorerFragment = new ExplorerFragment();
getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction()
      .add(R.id.container, explorerFragment).commit();
</pre>
Now, still in ExplorerActivity, provide proper implementation of
<code>onBackPressed</code>, e.g.<pre>
@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
   if (explorerFragment.currentDirectory != null) {
      explorerFragment.currentDirectory =
         explorerFragment.currentDirectory.getParentFile();
   }
   if (explorerFragment.currentDirectory != null) {
      explorerFragment.showCurrentDirectory();
   } else {
      super.onBackPressed();
   }
}
</pre>
Note: a more object-oriented approach is to put some of this logic into
the Fragment itself, but we only have fourteen hours to save the Earth!

<h3>Accessing External Storage</h3>
<p>To access external storage of the device, we need to declare the
permission in <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code>. When a user installs
your app, Android will list the permissions you have requested.</p>

<pre>
&lt;manifest ...>
    &lt;uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    ...
&lt;/manifest>
</pre>

<h3>Coping With Screen Rotation</h3>
Navigate to a sub-directory in Explorer. Now rotate the screen. Does it return
to the root directory? If we look at the life-cycle messages in the log, we
can see that rotating the device destroys both the Activity and the Fragment.
This is because we may well have different layout files for portrait and 
landscape, so Android destroys the Activity and all its Fragments, and
runs <code>Activity.onCreate()</code>, and when a Fragment is included in
the Activity layout, calls <code>Fragment.onCreate()</code> and
<code>Fragment.onCreateView()</code>.
This isn't always what we want, so there is a
method we can call in Fragment.onCreate():<pre>
setRetainInstance(true);
</pre>
This doesn't affect the Activity, but does mean that for the Fragment,
<code>onCreate()</code> and <code>onDestroy()</code> will not be called on
a configuration change - which is why we set the initial value of
currentDirectory in <code>onCreate()</code>. But onCreateView() will still
be called, so the view can be created from different resources.</p>

<p>With <code>setRetainInstance(true)</code> the current directory should now
be preserved when we rotate the phone. But what about preserving state within
the activity? If the activity is being re-created as a result of a configuration
change, or a pause while we receive a phone call, the UI state is preserved
in a Bundle which is passed to <code>onCreate()</code>. We can use this Bundle
as follows:</p><pre>
FragmentManager fragMan = getSupportFragmentManager();
if (savedInstanceState == null) {
   this.explorerFragment = new ExplorerFragment();
   fragMan.beginTransaction()
         .add(R.id.container, this.explorerFragment, "explorer")
         .commit();
} else {
   this.explorerFragment = (ExplorerFragment) fragMan
         .findFragmentByTag("explorer");
}
</pre>

<p>The current directory should now be preserved during screen rotations,
and the <i>back</i> button should still work.</p>
