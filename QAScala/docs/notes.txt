General: setup for course? confirmed? send in notes (below)?
	sample solutions?

Exercise 2 - Syntax Basics
	3 - using recursion
		algorithm should be x^n = x.x^n-1 if n is odd and +ve
		not x^n = n.x^n-1

OO Programming - slide 11, Companion Objects & Singletons
	"Objects are singletons, and members of objects are
	implicitly static"
	should this be
	"Objects are singletons, hence members of objects have
	similar characteristics to Java statics, but with
	inheritance & polymorphism"

Inheritance and Traits - slide 24, Packages
	is it appropriate to say "I think..."?
	
Numbering of exercises needs updating - 2 x Exercise 5

Collections and Generics, slide 27
	"A Stack can accept objects of type T or a subtype of T:
	abstract class Stack[+T]"
	perhaps better to say:
	if B is subclass of A then Stack[B] is a subtype of Stack[A]
	(as described in the notes on slide 29)

Collections and Generics, slide 29
	"but the fact that we put [+A] means that the type we're
	adding my not be an A." Both methods would work as they
	do without the '+'; see my comment for slide 27, plus
	description on slide 30.

Collections and Functional Programming, slide 19
	for(i <= 0 to 2; ...)
	should be: for(i <- 0 to 2; ...

Pattern Matching, slide 4
	1st sample gives compilation warning, as default case
	cannot be reached
	
Pattern Matching, slide 6
	"case constructors create objects and compare them with
	the argument" - what does this mean?
	
Exercise 7 - Pattern Matching
	not sure how to use pattern matching to solve this problem
